This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router Dom v6. The problem arises when a parent route contains a nested route, and the nested route is not correctly rendering.  The bug.js file contains the buggy code, while bugSolution.js provides the solution.  The issue is described further in the bug description.  Feel free to clone the repository and test the solution.
